/*
944. Delete Columns to Make Sorted

You are given an array of n strings strs, all of the same length.

The strings can be arranged such that there is one on each line, making a grid.
For example, strs = ["abc", "bce", "cae"] can be arranged as:

abc
bce
cae
You want to delete the columns that are not sorted lexicographically.
In the above example (0-indexed), columns 0 ('a', 'b', 'c') and 2 ('c', 'e', 'e') are sorted
while column 1 ('b', 'c', 'a') is not, so you would delete column 1.

Return the number of columns that you will delete.

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["cba","daf","ghi"]
Output: 1
Explanation: The grid looks as follows:
  cba
  daf
  ghi
Columns 0 and 2 are sorted, but column 1 is not, so you only need to delete 1 column.

TC : o(m*n)
SC : o(1)

                if(strs[j].charAt(i)>strs[j+1].charAt(i)){
                    count++;
                    break;
