3531. Count Covered Buildings

You are given a positive integer n, representing an n x n city. You are also given a 2D grid buildings, where buildings[i] = [x, y] denotes a unique building located at coordinates [x, y].

A building is covered if there is at least one building in all four directions: left, right, above, and below.

Return the number of covered buildings.



Example 1:

Input: n = 3, buildings = [[1,2],[2,2],[3,2],[2,1],[2,3]]

Output: 1

Explanation:

Only building [2,2] is covered as it has at least one building:
above ([1,2])
below ([3,2])
left ([2,1])
right ([2,3])
Thus, the count of covered buildings is 1.

SC: o(n)
