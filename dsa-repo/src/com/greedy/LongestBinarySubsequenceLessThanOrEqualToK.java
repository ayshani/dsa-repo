2311. Longest Binary Subsequence Less Than or Equal to K

You are given a binary string s and a positive integer k.

Return the length of the longest subsequence of s that makes up a binary number less than or equal to k.

Note:

The subsequence can contain leading zeroes.
The empty string is considered to be equal to 0.
A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.


Example 1:

Input: s = "1001010", k = 5
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest subsequence of s that makes up a binary number less than or equal to 5 is "00010", as this number is equal to 2 in decimal.
Note that "00100" and "00101" are also possible, which are equal to 4 and 5 in decimal, respectively.
The length of this subsequence is 5, so 5 is returned.

SC: o(1)
