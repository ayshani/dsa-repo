2749. Minimum Operations to Make the Integer Zero

You are given two integers num1 and num2.

In one operation, you can choose integer i in the range [0, 60] and subtract 2i + num2 from num1.

Return the integer denoting the minimum number of operations needed to make num1 equal to 0.

If it is impossible to make num1 equal to 0, return -1.



Example 1:

Input: num1 = 3, num2 = -2
Output: 3
Explanation: We can make 3 equal to 0 with the following operations:
- We choose i = 2 and subtract 22 + (-2) from 3, 3 - (4 + (-2)) = 1.
- We choose i = 2 and subtract 22 + (-2) from 1, 1 - (4 + (-2)) = -1.
- We choose i = 0 and subtract 20 + (-2) from -1, (-1) - (1 + (-2)) = 0.
It can be proven, that 3 is the minimum number of operations that we need to perform.

TC : o(lognum1)
SC: o(1)
