1071. Greatest Common Divisor of Strings

For two strings s and t, we say "t divides s" if and only if s = t + ... + t
(i.e., t is concatenated with itself one or more times).

Given two strings str1 and str2, return the largest string x such that x divides both str1 and str2.



Example 1:

Input: str1 = "ABCABC", str2 = "ABC"
Output: "ABC"

Complexity Analysis
Let m,n be the lengthes of the two input strings str1 and str2.

Time complexity: O(m+n)

We need to compare the two concatenations of length O(m+n), it takes O(m+n) time.
We calculate the GCD using binary Euclidean algorithm, it takes log(mâ‹…n) time.
To sum up, the overall time complexity is O(m+n).
Space complexity: O(m+n) We need to compare the two concatenations of length O(m+n).
