1653. Minimum Deletions to Make String Balanced

You are given a string s consisting only of characters 'a' and 'b'.

You can delete any number of characters in s to make s balanced. s is balanced if there is no pair of indices
(i,j) such that i < j and s[i] = 'b' and s[j]= 'a'.

Return the minimum number of deletions needed to make s balanced.



Example 1:

Input: s = "aababbab"
Output: 2
Explanation: You can either:
Delete the characters at 0-indexed positions 2 and 6 ("aababbab" -> "aaabbb"), or
Delete the characters at 0-indexed positions 3 and 6 ("aababbab" -> "aabbbb").

TC : o(n)
SC: o(n)
